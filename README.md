## Overview

I created this application to show case my ability to create a Geo Location Application that allows you to search any city in the world. This application shows the forecast for the next five days based on the day you searched and subsequently lists the corresponding dates and times for each. Underneath each icon for the type of weather for that day lists the UVI, Humidity, and Farenheit Temperature.

### Description

- Lists the present day's weather along with the forecast for the next five days.
- Application allows you to search any city in the world
